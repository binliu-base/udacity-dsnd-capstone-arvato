## Installation <a name="installation"></a>
Besides the libraries included in the Anaconda distribution for Python 3.6 the following libraries have been included in this project:
* `LGBM` -  Gradient boosting framework that uses tree based learning algorithms.
* `skopt` - Simple and efficient library to minimize (very) expensive and noisy black-box functions.
* `hyperopt` - Distributed hyperparameter optimization.

## Project Overview <a name="introduction"></a>

This is the capstone project of Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree, the data provided by Bertelsmann Arvato Analytics, and represents a real-life data science task.
The goal of this project is to predict which individuals are most likely to convert into becoming customers for a mail-order sales company in Germany.

Steps of this project are the following:
1. Customer Segmentation Report (Unsupervised Learning) - EDA, PCA and clustering analysis of the general and customer population with the goal of being able to describe the core customer base of the company.
2. Predict Customer Report (Supervised Learning) - Use what was observed in part 1 or parts of it to create a supervised learning model that could predict whether an individual would respond to a mail campaign.
3. Kaggle Competition - As a last step the predictions generated from the best performing model from part 2 could be submitted to Kaggle and compared against the other student submissions.

## Files <a name="files"></a>
Arvato provided a couple of files for this project but as part of the terms and conditions I'm not allowed to share/include them in this repository.

## Instructions <a name="instructions"></a>
As stated above the data for this project is not publicly available. For this reason the notebook and models provided by this repository cannot be used, but are made available to serve as a snapshot of the state of the project at the end.

## Results <a name="results"></a>

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>
I would like to thank Udacity, Arvato Bertelsmann and collaborate company to provide such wonderful datasets for me to learn and practice my machine
learning and data science skills.
